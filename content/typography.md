## **Overview**

Typography plays a huge role at Rewst. It’s our vessel for us to speak both internally and externally. We rely on things like layout, color, and weight to create a hierarchy for our communications. Below you will find helpful guidelines around when, where, and how to use our approved typefaces.

## **Goldplay**

At Rewst we use Goldplay Sans for everything brand and marketing—from banner ads to billboards. Goldplay Sans is rounded, soft terminals give it a friendly and expressive look, and its modern and contemporary style as well as its classic proportions make it an excellent choice for headlines, logotypes, branding

From the lettering that inspired it, Gotham inherited an honest tone that’s assertive but never imposing, friendly but never folksy, confident but never aloof.

## **Poppins**

Poppins is a geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the world’s stage. Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre. It is one of the fonts that has a wide range of readability, so it is very common to see it in running texts and in large headlines.

Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. The Devanagari design is particularly new, and is the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre. Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles.

Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal; Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high.

## **Arial**

Work Sans should be used whenever possible. However, when absolutely necessary the screen sans serif font Arial can be used as a substitute. It provides a similar feel and is easily accessible to anyone who may need to represent our brand.
