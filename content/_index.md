[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again.

Hugo Catalog is a conversion of the [Catalog](https://catalog.style) framework to a hugo theme, it also includes the ability to use [Decap](https://decapcms.org) (coming soon) to edit your content via a user friendly interface.

It ships with [10 shortcodes](/shortcodes) so your editors can make beautiful Style Guides for your brand without having to code.

> I made Hugo Catalog because Catalog is abandonware and I needed something my clients could use and edit themselves. - Ben Marte

This theme is under active development this means there will be bugs and I can't make no guarantees things won't break.

With that out of the way. We do appreciate feedback, bug issues and PRs. Thanks.
